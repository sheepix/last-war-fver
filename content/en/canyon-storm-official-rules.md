# Canyon Storm Battlefield — Official Rules (From the in‑game “Rules” panel)

> Compiled from the in‑game “Rules” panel. Values may change with patches; always follow the in‑game numbers.

## 1) Overview (short)
- Winning is primarily about **capture-point score**; kills are mainly for disruption and time gain.
- Battlefield skills only work inside Canyon Storm and require energy earned from battlefield actions.

## 2) Battlefield Skills (official CN names aligned)

| Skill (CN) | Faction / source | Type | Core effect (summary) | Duration | Energy | Cooldown |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Earthquake Tower (地震塔) | Rulebringers faction | Damage | On landing: **1000** base durability damage in an area; then every **3s** deal **300** durability damage and **60** troop damage in an area | 30s | 500000 | 300s |
| Battlefield Hospital (战地医院) | All factions | Support | Every **3s**: heal **150** wounded troops and restore **300** base durability to nearby allied bases | 30s | 500000 | 300s |
| Cannon Turret (炮塔) | Dawnbreakers faction | Damage | Every **3s**: deal **300** durability damage and **60** troop damage to the **nearest enemy base** in range | 30s | 750000 | 300s |
| Judgment Descent (裁决降临) | Rulebringers (Arbiter office) | Exclusive | Each landing deals **5000** durability damage in a large area; blowing away a base reduces cooldown by **30s**; if you get blown away, your teleport cooldown increases by **60s** | 120s | 1000000 | 300s |

## 3) Notes (avoid confusion)
- “Judgment Descent” is the **skill name**; “Arbiter” refers to the **office/holder** (often their top power).
- “Cannon Turret / Earthquake Tower” damage targets **bases** (durability/troops), not field units.

## 4) Buildings (compiled from the in‑game Buildings panel)

> This table reflects what’s visible in your screenshots; if there are “Building II / III” entries, add more screenshots and we can align them too.

| Building (CN) | Count / unlock | Capture output (score) | Key effect (summary) |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Data Center I (数据中心 I) | 2 total (always) | +20/s | Neutral building; continuously generates battlefield score when held. |
| Sample Warehouse I (样本仓库 I) | 4 total (always) | +15/s | Neutral building; continuously generates battlefield score when held. |
| Power Tower (供电塔) | Always | +50/s | If held by Rulebringers, it can activate the central safe-zone shield (bases inside cannot be attacked); also generates score. |
| Virus Lab (病毒实验室) | Unlocks after a while | +120/s | Primary high-score objective; generates a large amount of score. |
| Blastproof System I (防爆系统 I) | Unlocks after a while | +20/s | When held, automatically attacks core buildings occupied by the enemy (Virus Lab, Serum Factory, Blastproof System, Power Tower) and damages garrisoned troops. |
| Serum Factory I (血清工厂 I) | Unlocks after a while | +20/s | Periodically grants a buff to the garrison commander (buff is announced in advance). |
| Recon Station (侦查站) | Scattered | — | Collecting scattered recon stations grants battlefield score; find and collect early. |
| Score Supply Crate (积分补给箱) | Scattered / spawned | — | Occupied buildings will later produce score that can be looted; capturing them can steal that score. |

## 6) Rules & Flow (compiled from the in‑game “Rules” panel)

### Background (short)
Deep in a desolate canyon, a Doomsday Legion virus lab was exposed — the birthplace of the “Sample Zero” virus that once devastated the world.  
Rulebringers and Dawnbreakers rally their forces to seize control and resources: one side seeks the source, the other swears to stop humanity from sliding into ruin.

### How it works (overview)
1) Keep capturing buildings to generate battlefield score; the higher score at the end wins.  
2) The Virus Lab unlocks after the battle has progressed for a while and grants a large score output when held.  
3) Rulebringers start with control of the central safe zone; if Rulebringers hold the Power Tower, they can activate the central shield (bases inside cannot be attacked).  
4) Before entering, prepare your defensive/buff setup and plan rotations; execute per phase objectives.  
5) End-of-battle settlement follows the in-game results screen.

### Battle stages
1) **Roster selection**: the alliance’s R4/R5 selects participants and substitutes during registration; up to **20** participants and **10** substitutes per alliance. Participants have priority entry.  
2) **Entry requirements** (per the in-game rules): you must be a member of the registered alliance, be on the roster, and your base must not be in the restricted “black” area near the alliance.  
3) **Combat phases**:  
   - Preparation: both sides spawn in protected spawn zones (your side marked blue, enemy red); spawn zones cannot be attacked.  
   - Phase 1: Data Center I, Sample Warehouse I, and the Power Tower can be captured for score.  
   - Phase 2: Blastproof System I becomes capturable and can attack core buildings held by the enemy; Serum Factory I becomes available as well.  
   - Phase 3: Recon Stations (collectibles) grant score; Virus Lab unlocks and becomes the main high-score objective.  
4) **Win condition**: higher total battlefield score wins.  
5) **Note**: occupied buildings may later produce lootable score; breaking those buildings can steal that score (matches the “Score Supply Crate” mechanic).
