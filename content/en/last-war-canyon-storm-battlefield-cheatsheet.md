## 📝 Quick script (copy this)
- **Opening**: rush the **Power Station** and **Energy Stations** to secure early score and energy.  
- **Mid game**: the Rulebringers carry may use `Judgment Descent` to stomp clusters; use your numbers to **split-capture outer points**, or collapse on isolated targets.  
- **After ~12 minutes**: **Virus Lab** unlocks — all-in center; if you can’t win head‑on, rotate **Artillery Turret** casts to grind durability and troops.  
- **Last 3 minutes**: no matter the score, **hold points** — objective income flips games.  

## Two actives (most important)
- **Field Hospital**: your base transforms and teleports to the position you choose; lasts **30s**, continuously restores durability and heals severely wounded for you and nearby allies.  
- **Artillery Turret**: your base transforms and teleports to the position you choose; lasts **30s**, continuously damages the **nearest enemy base** in range.  

## Skill mechanics (how to cast)
- Skills have a fixed cooldown (CD), and you must charge enough energy through capturing/gathering/kills/garrisoning to use them.  
- The game randomly assigns a skill; only after you cast it will the next one be assigned
- When CD is ready and you have enough energy, tap the icon to cast; choose the landing position freely — **it’s a free teleport**

## ⚠️ How to survive “Judgment Descent”
1) **Don’t stack**: spread out so one landing can’t delete multiple bases (official panel CD is **300s**; blowing away 1 base reduces it by **30s**; verify in-game).  
2) **Bait the jump**: there’s usually a clear mark/effect; if you’re targeted, teleport at the last moment so they land on empty space.  
3) **If you can tank it, pop Hospital**: one stomp is about **5000** durability (a base is about **6000**). If you survive, use Hospital immediately to prevent getting finished.

## Serum Factory (late-game buff point)
Serum Factory unlocks later; it will randomly spawn a buff, and when the countdown ends it grants the holder the effect.  
The official description is “periodically grants a buff (announced in advance)”. If you can, capture/trigger it (e.g., “fatigue suppression” often **resets teleport cooldown** and **reduces teleport cooldown** for a short duration).
