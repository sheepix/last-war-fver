# S4 Tank Comp: 4 Tanks + 1 Missile (Adam) Mixed Team (Video Notes)

Source video: `https://youtu.be/NK_RIC8w8Ls?si=Bi0PAXbCb0RjkNy0`

This is a summarized takeaway from a strategy video for *Last War: Survival* Season 4 (S4): a strong “mixed” lineup built around a seasonal tactic card — **4 Tanks + 1 Missile (Adam)**.

## 1) Core Idea
### Seasonal tactic-card advantage
The key S4 tactic card (described in the video like “universal squad”) lets you include **one hero from a different faction** while still receiving the **full 5‑same‑faction bonus**, enabling a 4‑tank + 1‑missile mixed roster.

### The engine: Adam
Adam is the engine of the team. His kit (especially after unlocking his **exclusive weapon**) grants frontliners a **“defensive counterattack”** state.

**Mechanic**: when a frontliner with this state is hit, they immediately perform a normal-attack counter.

## 2) Recommended lineup & positioning
### Frontline
- **Scarlett**  
  - Why frontline: high defense and extremely high normal-attack damage (the video claims up to ~1400% physical scaling), but slow attack speed.  
  - Synergy: Adam’s counterattack makes her **counter-hit on every incoming attack**, turning slow speed into repeated high-damage swings.
- **Kimberly**  
  - Role: primary damage dealer; becomes much stronger after exclusive weapon level 30.  
  - Why can frontline: higher HP/tankiness lets her trade while still outputting.

### Backline
- **Adam**: core support who enables counterattacks; keep him safer in the back.  
- **Marshall**: team buffs + “pick” tool; his exclusive mechanic can lock onto the enemy’s highest-attack unit (often DVA) to help delete the enemy core.  
- **Murphy**: tank that adds mitigation and protection for the frontline, increasing overall durability.

## 3) Matchups & practical tips
### Strong into Air squads
Air comps often rely on “energy damage reduction”, while Scarlett deals primarily **physical damage**.  
With Adam’s buff, she can repeatedly deliver heavy physical counters and punish air cores (especially squishier units like DVA).

### Mirror / same-comp play
- **Priority: kill the enemy Adam first**. Once Adam is down, their frontline loses counterattack and their damage drops sharply.  
- **Adjustment**: use Marshall’s targeting behavior to steer focus onto Adam; if needed, position Murphy to soak more hits (“sacrifice”) to protect your core damage.

## 4) Summary
This comp maximizes Scarlett’s normal-attack value through Adam’s counter mechanic. It’s strong at equal power and can even punch up into popular Air squads — a solid S4 option for low-spend players.
