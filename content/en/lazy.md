# fver — Canyon Storm Battlefield Cheatsheet (Dawnbreakers Side)

> Terminology: **fver is the alliance name**. **Dawnbreakers** is the event faction name (this cheatsheet assumes you are playing on the Dawnbreakers side).

> For quick execution and fewer mistakes. Full version: [Beginner Field Guide](../last-war-canyon-storm-battlefield-beginner-guide/).

## One-line Goal
**Capture points > kills**: with 40 vs 20, pressure multiple lanes and win the center with a single coordinated wave.

## Three Rules (memorize)
1) **Go center when it opens**: Virus Lab / Power Station decide the game.  
2) **If Arbiter is jumping, spread out**: don’t stack and feed cooldown refreshes.  
3) **Low-power value = garrison + Hospital + banners**: don’t duel carries.

## Battlefield Actives
Only available in Canyon Storm. Build energy through kills/captures/gathering.

### Field Hospital = “Save me” button
- Effect: every **3s** restore **300 durability** to nearby allied bases and heal **150 severely wounded** units, lasts **30s**.
- When to press:  
  - **You survive an Arbiter stomp**: press immediately to avoid being finished by the next jump.  
  - **Center fights**: low-power players pop it to sustain the front line.

### Artillery Turret = “Grind them” button
- Effect: every **2s** deal **300 durability** to the nearest enemy base in range and inflict **60 severely wounded** units.
- When to press:  
  - **Enemy carry sits on a point**: rotate turret casts near them until they retreat.

## ⚠️ Enemy-only Skill: Arbiter
- Effect: **120s** duration; each landing deals **5000** durability in a large area (typical max ~**6000**).  
- Cooldown: blow away one of you → their cooldown **-30s**; you get blown away → your cooldown **+60s**.

### Four counters (copy-paste)
1) **Spread out**: loose ring around buildings; never stack.  
2) **Bait and dodge**: teleport at the last moment so they land on empty space.  
3) **Hospital stabilize**: survive once → pop Hospital and force them to spend another full jump.  
4) **Turret attrition**: rotate turrets to bleed durability and troops.

## Professions (pick by role)
- **Engineer (support)**: Siege Banner + Medical Aid.  
- **War Leader (carry)**: Recall + Fanaticism/Burst.

## “One-wave” order (when called to focus center)
1) Engineers: drop **Siege Banners**.  
2) Use **Artillery Turret** if you have energy; use **Field Hospital** if you’re not healthy.  
3) Carries: start the rally.  
4) Low-power: garrison instantly after capture.

## Timeline
- **0–10 min**: gain energy; flank-capture if you can’t fight.  
- **~12:00**: Virus Lab opens → all to center; banners + Hospital + turret rotations.  
- **Last 3 min**: full pressure; if close, brute-force contest for time.
