# Canyon Storm Battlefield Beginner Guide (Dawnbreakers Side)

## Battlefield Overview
- **Win condition**: Capture-point score matters more than kills. Rotate “capture → hold → swap”.
- **Team identity**: 40 vs 20 plays like a pack — multi-lane pressure + concentrated bombardment.
- **Mindset**: Clones are expendable. Trade bodies for the enemy’s time, focus, and stamina.

## Skills & Loadout
Battlefield skills only work inside the Canyon Storm map. You build energy through battlefield actions (kills, capturing, gathering) and then cast them.

### 1) Battlefield Active Skills
- **Core survivability: Field Hospital**  
  - Type: Support / Recovery  
  - Effect: After use, your base teleports and transforms. Upon landing, every **3s** it restores **300 base durability** to nearby allied bases and heals **150 severely wounded** units, lasting **30s**.  
  - Use cases: Counter “Arbiter” pressure (if you’re left at low durability, pop it to avoid being finished by a second jump); in central fights, low-power players can act as a moving sustain source for the front-liners.
- **Core damage: Artillery Turret**  
  - Type: Damage / Harass  
  - Effect: After use, your base teleports and transforms. Upon landing, every **2s** it deals **300 durability damage** to the **nearest enemy base** in range and inflicts **60 severely wounded** units.  
  - Use cases: Rulebringers only have 20 players. If their carry sits on a point, rotate members to teleport nearby and keep turret pressure to grind durability and troops until they disengage.

### 2) ⚠️ High-Risk Warning: Enemy-Only Skill “Arbiter”
- Owner: The Rulebringers’ Arbiter office holder (usually their top power).  
- Effect: Lasts **120s**. Each teleport landing deals **5000 base durability** damage in a large area (a typical base has ~**6000** total durability, so this is near-lethal).  
- Cooldown mechanic (key): If they destroy (blow away) a base, their teleport cooldown is reduced by **30s**; if you get blown away, your teleport cooldown is increased by **60s**.  

#### How to Counter It
- **Tactic 1: Spread out**  
  Surround key buildings (Virus Lab / Power Station) loosely. Never stack tightly — one landing must not delete multiple bases, otherwise they chain refresh.
- **Tactic 2: Bait and dodge**  
  When you see the special mark and repeated jumps, call it out. If you’re targeted, use a random/advanced teleport right before they land to make the jump miss and waste their 120s window.
- **Tactic 3: Hospital to “stabilize”**  
  If you survive a stomp, immediately pop Field Hospital to raise durability and turn a losing situation into one that costs them another full jump.
- **Tactic 4: Turret attrition**  
  If the Arbiter sits on a point, rotate Artillery Turret casts to bleed durability and troops, forcing them to retreat.

**Mnemonic**: See Arbiter → spread out. Low durability → pop Hospital. Make them jump into empty space. After two minutes, swarm back and take the points.

### 3) Profession Skills
Swap professions and skills based on your role (carry attacker vs low-power support).

- **Support / Garrison filler: Engineer**  
  - Must-have: Siege Banner — place banners to increase allied attack in range (stackable). In fights for Virus Lab / Power Station, Engineers ring the building with banners to boost your front-liners.  
  - Must-have: Medical Aid — speeds up hospital healing so you can refill and return quickly.
- **Main force / Rally role: War Leader**  
  - Must-have: Recall — tactical reset to avoid being isolated by Arbiter pressure.  
  - Must-have: Fanaticism / Burst — short, high burst window for the last hit to secure building ownership.

### 4) “One-Wave” Execution (when the commander calls “focus center”)
1) Engineers first: drop **Siege Banners** next to the target building (the more the better).  
2) Cast battlefield skills: if you have energy, use **Artillery Turret** near defenders to burn durability; if you’re not healthy, use **Field Hospital** first.  
3) Carries: start the **rally** with your mitigation/buff setup.  
4) Low-power players: once the building is taken, **garrison immediately** to fill slots, letting carries rotate to the next objective.

**Mnemonic**: Prep your mitigation/buff loadout (note: if S04 isn’t live yet, you may not have the seasonal cards — use your best defensive setup). Engineers drop banners. See Arbiter → Hospital. Rotate Turrets on defenders.

## Building Priority
1) **Virus Lab (★★★★★, opens around 12:00)**  
   - Rally center before it opens. If you hold it: new players garrison as meat shields. If you lose it: schedule turret rotations to break defenders.
2) **Power Station (★★★★)**  
   - You holding it = points + energy; enemy holding it = shield threat. Keep a squad to contest and never leave it unattended.
3) **Data Center / Sample Warehouse (★★★)**  
   - New players’ job: flank-capture to split enemies. Holding it is profit; losing it still drains their attention.

## Three-Phase Playbook
- **0–10 minutes**  
  Push left/right lanes, secure energy. Avoid hard duels vs carries; call for help or flank-capture.
- **12-minute fight**  
  Move to center on system notice. Engineers banner first. If you control it: garrison + Hospital. If the enemy controls it: turret rotations + repeated contesting. If Arbiter chains jumps, spread instantly.
- **Last 3 minutes**  
  Full-map pressure, no speed-ups saved. If the score is close, brute-force contest to stall — every second of capture time matters.

## Team & Mobility
- **Follow calls**: track alliance chat/voice and sync push timings.
- **Teleports**: use free/random/advanced teleports to rotate to hot zones or escape at low durability (also to bait Arbiter into missing).
- **Gathering & supply crates**: if you can’t fight, be the courier — steady points and forces enemy splits.

## Quick Tips
- Garrison order: carries take slots first; new players fill. At capture moments, drop Hospital before reinforcements.
- Turret timing: rotate casts in pairs to avoid downtime; aim at enemy bases holding/defending buildings.
- Vision & marks: spot an enemy carry → mark and call it; don’t wander alone.

## One Line
Multi-lane pressure with 40, turret-bombard the center, flank-capture the outer points — make 20 elites choose what to lose.

## FAQ
### Q: Does everyone get the same skills, or only one player?
A: It’s a mixed system: **most battlefield skills are available to all participants, but the deadliest “Judgment Descent” is limited to a small number of appointed players**.

#### 1) Skills most players can use (once you have enough energy)
You earn energy through kills/captures/gathering and then cast:
- Dawnbreakers side:
  - **Cannon Turret (炮塔)**: any Dawnbreakers participant can cast it when they have enough energy (this is why “pack tactics” works — 40 players rotating casts is huge).
  - **Battlefield Hospital (战地医院)**: a universal survivability skill; everyone can use it.
- Rulebringers side:
  - **Earthquake Tower (地震塔)**: an attrition skill similar to Cannon Turret; any Rulebringers participant can cast it with enough energy.
  - **Battlefield Hospital (战地医院)**: same as above (universal).

#### 2) Limited‑access skill (key)
- **Skill**: Judgment Descent (裁决降临)  
- **Who can use it**: only the Rulebringers’ appointed Arbiter office holder(s) (typically the top power; per the in‑game faction panel it can be 1–2 players).  
- **Takeaway**: Dawnbreakers do not have a “single nuke” role — your advantage is numbers and shared tools; their advantage is a small number of Arbiters who can snowball fights.

**Counter tip**: watch the enemy Arbiter(s) with the special mark — they are the only ones who can reliably “stomp-delete” bases. Treat the rest more like standard PvP while you play the objective.
